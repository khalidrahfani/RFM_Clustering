# RFM_Clustering
This Repo is about a Project I made with my Binome Mr Oukacha Mustapha on the Clustering Algorithms of Clients using RFM method.

Data set Used is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail.

The Project is using all the most known Algorithms to get to the most accurate one to deal with the Dataset and provide a useful output to be used by The Sales Teams when dealing with the Clients of Different Clusters.
